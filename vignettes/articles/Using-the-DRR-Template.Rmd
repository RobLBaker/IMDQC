# Overview

Data Release Reports (DRRs) are created by the National Park Service and
provide detailed descriptions of valuable research datasets, including
the methods used to collect the data and technical analyses supporting
the quality of the measurements. Data Release Reports focus on helping
others reuse data, rather than presenting results, testing hypotheses,
or presenting new interpretations, methods or in-depth analyses.

DRRs are intended to document the processing of fully-Quality-Assured data to their
final (Quality Controlled) form in a reproducible and transparent manner. DRRs
document the data collection methods and quality standards used to
prepare and review data prior to release. DRRs present the quality of
resultant data in the context of fitness for their intended use.

Each DRR cites source and resultant data packages that are published
concurrently and cross-referenced. Associated data packages are made publicly
available with the exception of data that must be protected from release
as per NPS and park-specific policies.

Data packages that are published concurrently with DRRs are intended to
be independently citable scientific works that can serve as the basis
for subsequent analysis and reporting by NPS or third parties.

# Project Set-up

To set up a project, follow the instructions in the Article, ["Starting a DRR"](Starting-a-DRR.html).

# Reproducible Reports

## Code Chunks

The DRR Template takes advantage of rmarkdown code chunks to help generate a reproducible report. The template includes all of the required code chunks. Some of these code chunks need to be edited to generate the report, others should not be edited. Below is description of each code chunk in the DRR Template and instructions on how to (and when not to) edit them.

In addition to the report outline and a description of content for each
section, the template includes four standard code chunks.

**YAML Header:**

The YAML header helps format the DRR. You should not need to edit any of
the YAML header.

**R code chunks:**

-   `user_edited_parameters`. A series of parameters that are used in
    the creation of the DRR and may be re-used in metadata and
    associated data package construction. You will need to edit these
    parameters for each DRR.

    -   `title`. The title of the Data Release Report.
    -   `report_number`. This is optional, and should *only* be included
        if publishing in the semi-official DRR series. Set to NULL if
        there is no reportNumber.
    -   `drr_ds_ref_id`. This is the DataStore reference ID for the
        report. It should be 7 digits long.
    -   `authorNames`. A list of the author's names. If an author has multiple
        institutional affiliations, the author should be listed once for each
        affiliation.
    -   `author_affiliations`. A list of the author's affiliations. The
        order of author affiliations must match the order of the authors
        in the `authorNames` list. Note that the entirety of each
        affiliation is enclosed in a single set of quotations. Do not worry
        about indentation or word wrapping. If two authors have the same
        affiliation, list the affiliation twice.
    -   `author_orcid`. A list of ORCID iDs for each author in the format
        "(xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx)". If an author does not have an ORCID iD,
        specify NA (no quotes). The order of ORCID iDs (and NAs) must
        correspond to the order of authors in the `authorNames` list. If an 
        author was listed more than once in the `authorNames` list, the 
        corresponding ORCID (or NA) should also be listed more than once. Future
        iterations of the DRR Template will pull ORCID iDs from metadata and
        eventually from Active Directory. See [ORCID](https://www.orcid.org/)
        for more information about ORCID iDs or to register an ORCID iD.
    -   `drr_abstract`. The abstract for the DRR (which may be distinct
        from the data package abstract). Pay careful attention to
        non-standard characters, line breaks, carriage returns, and
        curly-quotes. You may find it useful to write the abstract in
        NotePad or some other text editor and NOT a word processor (such
        as Microsoft Word). Indicate line breaks with \n and a space
        between paragraphs - should you want them - using \n\n. The
        Abstract should succinctly describe the study, the assay(s)
        performed, the resulting data, and their reuse potential, but
        should not make any claims regarding new scientific findings. No
        references are allowed in this section. A good suggested length
        for abstracts is less than 250 words.
    -   `data_package_ref_id`. DataStore reference ID for the data package
        associated with this report. You must have at least one data
        package. Eventually, we will automate importing much of this
        information from metadata and include the ability to describe
        multiple data packages in a single DRR.
    -   `data_P_package_T_title`. The title of the data package. Must match
        the title on DataStore (and metadata).
    -   `data_package_description`. A short title/subtitle or short
        description for the data package. Must match the data package
        metadata.
    -   `data_package_DOI_doi`. Auto-generated, no need to edit or update.
        This is the data package DOI. It is based on the DataStore
        reference number.
    -   `data_package_file_names`. List the file names in your data
        package. Do NOT include metadata files. For example, include
        "my_data.csv" but do NOT include "my_metadata.xml". Note: Because data
        packages contain only .csv and .xml files, all data files should be
        .csv.
    -   `data_package_file_sizes`. List the approximate size of each data
        file. Make sure the order of the file sizes corresponds to the
        order of file names in `dataPackage_fileNames`.
    -   `data_package_file_descript`. A short description of the
        corresponding data file that helps distinguish it from other
        data files. A good guideline is 10 words or less. This will be
        used in a table summary table so brevity is a priority. If you
        have already created metadata for your data package in EML
        format, this should be the same text as found in the
        "entityDescription" element for each data file.
-   `setup_do_not_edit`. Most users will not need to edit this code chunk. There
    is one code snippet for loading packages; the `r_packages` section is a
    suite of packages that are used to assist with reproducible
    reporting. You may not need these for your report, but we have
    included them as part of the base recommended packages. If you plan to
    perform you QC as part of the DRR construction process, you can add a second
    code snipped to import necessary packages for your QC process here.

-   `title_do_not_edit`. These parameters are auto-generated based on
    either the EML you supplied (when that becomes an option) or the
    information you've already supplied under "user-edited-parameters".
    You really should not need to edit these parameters.

-   `authors_do_not_edit`. There is no need to edit this chunk. This
    writes the author names, ORCID iDs, and affiliations to the .docx
    document based on information supplied in user-edited-parameters.

-   `file_table`. Do not edit. Generates a table of file names, sizes,
    and descriptions in the data package being described by the DRR.
    
-   `data_acceptance_criteria`. If you did not use the standard data quality
    assurance flags (A = accepted, AE = Accepted (estimated), R = Rejected, P =
    Provisional), set this code chunk to `eval = FALSE` and generate your own
    custom code chunk to summarize your custom data flagging procedures. If you
    did use the standard QA flags, indicate which fields in your data files
    contain flagged data. Assuming your column names are unique, you do not need
    to specify which file the columns are in. If your column names are not
    unique, you will need to design your own summary table. Briefly describe the
    acceptance criteria for each data quality flagged column in the same order
    as the you specified the columns.

-   `data_column_flagging`. Uses the input from `data_acceptance_criteria` to
    generate a table summarizing the data quality flagging in the data package.
    If you set `data_acceptance_criteria` parameter `eval = FALSE`, also set
    `data_column_flagging` parameter to `eval = FALSE`. Update the first line
    (which in the example points to BICY_Example) to point to the directory
    where your data are.
    
-   `data_package_flagging`. If you used standard QA flags in your data package,
    leave the parameter `eval = TRUE`. If you did not use standard QA flags, set
    `eval = FALSE` and design your own custom summary table to handle your
    custom flagging protocols. If you set `eval = TRUE`, update the file path
    to pointing to your data files (in the example, the path points to the
    directory "BICY_Example").

-   `figure1`. This is an example code chunk for inserting figures. Edit and
    re-deploy as necessary to include as many or as few figures as your require.

-   `listing`. Appendix A, by default is the code listing. This will
    generate all code used in generating the report and data packages.
    In most cases, code listing is not required. If all QA/QC processes
    and data manipulations were performed elsewhere, you should cite
    that code (in the methods and references) and leave the "listing
    code chunk with the default settings of eval=FALSE and echo=FALSE.
    If you have developed custom scripts, you can add those to DataStore
    with the reference "Script" and cite them in the DRR.

-   `session_info` is the information about the versions of R and
    packages used in generating the report. In most cases, you do not
    need to report session info (leave the session-info code chunk
    parameters in their default state: eval=FALSE). Session and version
    information is only necessary if you have set the "Listing" code
    chunk in appendix A to eval=TRUE. In that case, change the "session
    info" code chunk parameters to eval=TRUE.

## Editing the Text 

The following text in the body of the DRR template will need to be
edited to customize it to each data package.

### Data Records

This is a required section and consists of two subheadings:

-   **Data inputs** - an optional subsection used to describe datasets
    that the data package is based on if it is a re-analysis,
    reorganization, or re-integration of prevously existing data sets.

-   **Summary of datasts created** - this is a required section used to
    explain each data record associated with the work (for instance, a
    data package), including the DOI indicating where this information
    is stored. It shoudl also provide an overview of the data files and
    their formats. Each external data record should be cited.

Sample text is included that uses r code to incorporate previously
specified parameters such as the data package title, file names, and
DOI.

A code for a sample table summarizing the contents of the data package
(except the metadata) is provided.

### Data Quality

This is a required section. and the text includes multiple suggested
text elements and code for an example table defining data flagging
codes. Near future development here will incorporate additional optional
tables to summarize the data quality based on the flags in the data
sets.

### Usage Notes

This is a required section that should contain brief instructions to
assist other researchers with reuse of the data. This may include
discussion of software packages (with appropriate citations) that are
suitable for analysing the assay data files, suggested downstream
processing steps (e.g. normalization, etc.), or tips for integrating or
comparing the data records with other datasets. Authors are encouraged
to provide code, programs or data-processing workflows if they may help
others understand or use the data.

### Methods

This is a required section that cites previous methods used but should
also be detailed enough in describing data production including the
experimental design, data acquisition assays, and any computational
processing (e.g. normalization, QA, QC) such that others can understand
the methods without referring to associated publications.

Optional sub-sections within the methods include:

-   **Data Collection and Sampling**
-   **Additional Data Sources**
-   **Data Processing**
-   **Code availability**

## References

This required section includes full bibliographic references for each
paper, chapter, book, data package, dataset, protocol, etc cited within
the DRR. Each item in the Reference section should be specifically cited in-text as well.

#### Automating Citations

To automate citations, add the citation in bibtex format to the file
"references.bib". You can manually copy and paste the bibtex for each
reference in, or you can search for it from within Rstudio. From within
Rstudio, make sure you are editing the DRR rmarkdown template using the "Visual" view
(as opposed to "Source"). From the "Insert" drop-down menu, select "\@
Citation..." (shortcut: Cntrl-Shift-F8). This will open a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) tool where you can view all the citations in your
reference.bib file as well as search multiple databases for references,
automatically insert the bibtex for the reference into your
references.bib file (and customize the unique identifier if you'd like)
and insert the in-text citation into the DRR template.

```{r fig2, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%",  fig.align="center", fig.cap="Adding Citations - Source vs. Visual editing of the Template and how to access the citation manager."}
knitr::include_graphics("RMD_vis_source.png")
```

```{r fig3, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.width="50%",  fig.align="center", fig.cap="Adding Citations - Using the citation manager."}
knitr::include_graphics("R_citation_manager.png")
```

Once a reference is in your references.bib file, using the Visual view
of the template you can simply type the '\@' symbol and select which
reference to insert in the text.

If you need to edit how the citation is displayed after inserting it
into the text, switch back to the "Source" view. Each bibtex citation
should start with a unique identifier; the example reference in the
supplied references.bib file has the unique identifier
"@article{Scott1994,". Using the "Source" view in Rstudio, insert the
reference in your text, by combining the "at" symbol with the portion of
the unique identifier after the curly bracket: @Scott1994 .

| Syntax                                                               | Result                                       |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `@Scott1994` concludes that ...                                      | Scott et al., 1994 concludes that ...                                       |

The full citation, properly formatted, will be included in a "References" section at the end of the rendered MS Word document. . . though it is also worth visually
inspecting the .docx for citation completeness and formatting.

#### Manual citations

If you would like to format your citations manually, please feel free to
do so. Make sure to look at the References section of the DRR Template for how to
properly format each citation type.

There are numerous examples of proper formatting for each of these.
Future versions of the DRR will enable automatic reference formatting
given a correctly formatted bibtex file with the references (.bib).

## Figures

Figures should be inserted using code chunks in all cases so that figure
settings can be set in the chunk header. The chunk header should at a
minimum set the fig.align parameter to “center” and the specify the
figure caption (fig.cap parameter). Inserting figures this way will
ensure that the caption is properly formatted and it will apply copy the
caption to the figure’s “alt text” tag, making it 508-compliant.

For example:

```` markdown
`r ''````{r fig2, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Example general workflow to incude in the methods section."} 
knitr::include_graphics("ProcessingWorkflow.png")
```
````

Results in:

```{r fig4, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Example general workflow to incude in the methods section."}
#knitr::include_graphics("ProcessingWorkflow.png")
```

## Tables

Tables should be created using the kable function. Specifying the
caption in the kable function call (as opposed to inline markdown text)
will ensure that the caption is appropriately formatted.

For example:

```` markdown
`r ''````{r Table2, echo=FALSE}
c1<-c("Protocol1","Protocol2","Protocol3")
c2<-c("Park Unit 1","Park Unit 2","Park Unit 3")
c3<-c("Site 1","Site 2","Site 3")
c4<-c("Date 1","Date 2","Date 3")
c5<-c("GEOXXXXX","GEOXXXXX","GEOXXXXX")
Table2<-data.frame(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5)

kable(Table2, 
      col.names=c("Subjects","Park Units","Locations","Sampling Dates","Data"),
      caption="**Table 1.** Monitoring study example Data Records table.") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width=F)
```
````

Results in:

```{r Table2, echo=FALSE}
c1<-c("Protocol1","Protocol2","Protocol3")
c2<-c("Park Unit 1","Park Unit 2","Park Unit 3")
c3<-c("Site 1","Site 2","Site 3")
c4<-c("Date 1","Date 2","Date 3")
c5<-c("GEOXXXXX","GEOXXXXX","GEOXXXXX")
Table2<-data.frame(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5)

kable(Table2, 
      col.names=c("Subjects","Park Units","Locations","Sampling Dates","Data"),
      caption="**Table 1.** Monitoring study example Data Records table.") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),full_width=F)
```

# Non-reproducible Reports

You can generate a .docx document manually without ussing the DRR Template. The .docx, if properly formatted, can be ingested by the publication software. Assuming the manually created .docx also has all the required components and information, it can pass the review process and be published. The final product should be indistinguishable from one generated using the DRR Template. 

Manually generating a .docx for DRR publication is not suggested and not supported.

# Publishing DRRs

## Report Numbers

Because data release reports and associated data packages are
cross-referential, report numbers are typically assigned early in data
processing and quality evaluation.

-   **DataStore Reference Numbers.** When developing a report and data
    packages, DataStore references should be created as early in the
    process as practicable. While the report and data packages are in
    development, these should not be activated.

-   **Report Numbers.** If you are planning to publish a Data Release
    Report with an official DRR number, please contact the IMD Deputy
    Chief with the DataStore reference number associated with the DRR.

-   **Persistent Identifiers.** Digital object identifiers (DOIs) will
    be assigned to all DRRs and concurrently published data packages.
    DOIs will resolve to a DataStore Reference; DOIs are reserved when a
    draft reference is initiated in DataStore. They are not activated
    until the publication process, including relevant review, is
    complete.

DRR DOIs have the format: <https://doi.org/10.36967/xxxxxxx>

Data package DOIs have the format: <https://doi.org/10.57830/xxxxxxx>

Where the "xxxxxx" is the 7-digit DataStore reference number.

## Liability Statements

Under no circumstances should reports and associated data packages or
metadata published in the DRR series contain disclaimers or text that
suggests that the work does not meet scientific integrity or information
quality standards of the National Park Service. The following
disclaimers are suitable for use, depending on whether the data are
provisional or final (or approved or certified).

> **For approved & published data sets:** "Unless otherwise stated, all
> data, metadata and related materials are considered to satisfy the
> quality standards relative to the purpose for which the data were
> collected. Although these data and associated metadata have been
> reviewed for accuracy and completeness and approved for release by the
> National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Division, no warranty
> expressed or implied is made regarding the display or utility of the
> data for other purposes, nor on all computer systems, nor shall the
> act of distribution constitute any such warranty."

> **For provisional data:** "The data you have secured from the National
> Park Service (NPS) database identified as [database name] have not
> received approval for release by the NPS Inventory and Monitoring
> Division, and as such are provisional and subject to revision. The
> data are released on the condition that neither the NPS nor the U.S.
> Government shall be held liable for any damages resulting from its
> authorized or unauthorized use."
