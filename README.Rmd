# QCkit

QCkit is a collection of quality control functions to munge, check, flag, correct, and summarize data collected by the U.S. National Park Service Inventory & Monitoring Division. These functions will be particularly useful in preparing data for metadata creation and in writing Data Release Reports, but may include aspects that are more widely applicable outside the National Park Service (such as converting UTMs to Latitude and Longitude).

Functions are typically user generated and so may not have been thoroughly tested for all use cases.

If you would like to contribute useful functions please initiate a pull request.

Please request enhancements and bug fixes through [Issues](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/QCkit/issues).
